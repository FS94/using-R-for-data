Silva 2022-06-15 Chapter 1 Introduction This is a guide on R and its role in basic data manipulation. It requires no prior experience/knowledge in R. Currently, it is divided into 3 chapters. Chapter 1 will introduce you to R and provide you the basic programming tools, alongside other useful tips, to help you navigate R. Chapter 2 will introduce you to data management tools. Chapter 3 will introduce you to a more practical example of data exploration, emphasizing plot building. In the future I plan to further elaborate on this guide, but for now I think its good enough for most people to get a picture on what R is, why you should use it, as well as, of course, how to use it. I hope you learn something and find this guide useful.

However, this is not meant to give you all the guidance and know-how, as well as answer all your questions. There are plenty of internet tutorials already that answer more specific and basic questions. Ill provide a few links at the end that complement what Ill show you here. 2.2 What is R and RStudio From their own website, simply put R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics.. So R is a programming language, just like Python, Matlab or even the syntax you find in SPSS. This language is particularly driven towards mathematical operations and thus proves quite useful when it comes to data management and analysis. Importantly, its an expansive (things keep getting added all the time) and open-source (the code is freely available). As for RStudio, it is an interface for this programming language. Simply put, it makes working with R easier and everyone (in general) uses this interface to code in R. When you install R it already installs a very basic editor that lets you do some stuff, but RStudio is way more convening for everything other than simple calculations. You can see the basic R editor as Textpad (or Notepad application) and RStudio as Word. 2.3 Why R? Here follows a list of things R is can do (and excels, pun intended, at): Read (nearly) all types of data. Manipulate data in every way possible. Create any type of graphic data visualization. Perform any type of statistical analysis. Perform any type of machine learning applications. Web scraping. Creating reports. Creating web apps. Many more 2.4 Where to get it and how to run it You can download R from https://cran.r-project.org/ and RStudio from https://www.rstudio.com/. 2.5 Environment This is your basic environment. You have 4 (actually 5 with the upper bar area) divisions. The top pane (1), gives you access to plenty of options regarding RStudio, letting you open files, save, search, etc.. The pane number 2 is your main area of work. This is your script. The script is the area where you will write your code. This code (all or whatever lines you select) will then be executed in the console. The console (4) is where your code is executed. You can write single lines directly into it. This is where your information about your errors will show up. Your right area of the screen contains 2 distinct areas, that can show different things. Area number 3 usually contains your environment. In here you will see every variable that you have attributed (they will be stored here). You can access them by clicking on them. It also contains other sub menus, but I will not go into detail here. The bottom area (5) contains the files that are in the directory where you area working, will show your plots, will contain your packages (for easy access), the help menu and the viewer (interactive plots pane). Note, all of your environment is customizable, changing both what panels appear and where, and the overall appearance of Rstudio (you change to dark mode if you think youre cool enough, for instance). R IDE. 2.6 Scripts, Notebooks and RMarkdown In creating a new R script you can choose one of three different R documents, R Script, R Notebook and R Markdown. Well you can actually choose more, but these are perhaps (particularly regarding the focus of this book) the most important ones. R script is a simple sheet where you write code and add comments by using #. R scripts are best used when are writing scripts for automacy (automating tasks) and dont necessarily need to view any output along the way, but only at the end (when everything is computed and done). Otherwise, I would almost always recommend either one of the other two formats. The other two formats are pretty much the same. They only differ in terms of their preview function. These types of special scripts are built with a markdown language, such that the script panel can now be seen as a text document and you can, within that text document, insert code chunks and run these code chunk as needed. Importantly, and perhaps one of the best features, is that the output of each chunk is, by default, shown just below that code chunk. This makes these scripts extremely useful when doing data analysis of any kind, given that, provided that they are not too messy, they have the potential to make great reports of your data analysis (showing results and graphs along the way). So if you are new o this, I would recommend using R Notebook otherwise just default to R Markdown. 2.7 Working directories Whenever you create a new R-type file (e.g., R-script, Rmarkdown, etc.) and you save it somewhere (e.g., C:/Users/fabio/OneDrive/My Things/Stats/Teaching/R_Book) it sets your working directory to that folder. You can change verify this by using the command getwd(). You can also alter this working directory by executing setwd('what working directory I want\"). Importantly, when saving your working directory it should in a string format and separated by / and not \\. For instance setwd(\"C:/Users/MyName/Work/Project1\"). 2.8 Operators R has arithmetic operators and logical operators. The first ones, arithmetic operators are the following (there are more but, I believe, less important): +: adds -: subtracts *: multiplies /: divides ^ or **: exponentiates Then there are logical operators: &lt;: lesser than &lt;=: lesser or equal than &gt;: bigger than &gt;=: bigger or equal than ==: equals !=: not equal to !x: not x x | y: x OR y x &amp; y: x AND y 2.9 Classes, Types and Structures The data you imported can be in a wide range of classes (types). There are 3 basic types of classes, built-in (different functions can use more), you need to be aware (although there are more). These are: character: Strings (words), such as \"hello\" or \"hi123\". numeric: Any type of number, such as 2or 30.4. logical: The true or false values. TRUE or FALSE. date: In a date format. Can be converted from different types (e.g., 2007-11-11, 2jan1960) You can ask R about what type of object it is by using the class(object) command or the typeof(object) R also has different data structures. The ones worth talking about here are: atomic vector: Basically every R data structure. A vector could be a character or an numeric object, for instance. lists: a list of objects. Can be created by using list(). You can retrieve the value by using [[]]. my_list &lt;- list(&#39;Potatoes&#39;, TRUE, 15, c(&#39;Strawberry&#39;, 1000)) # or my_list &lt;- list(ingredients = c(&#39;Strawberry&#39;, &#39;Milk&#39;, &#39;Coffee&#39;), type = &#39;Milkshake&#39;, rating = 10) matrix: are like tables. my_matrix &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, ncol = 3) my_matrix &lt;- matrix(1:9, nrow = 3, dimnames = list(c(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;,&quot;Z&quot;), c(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;,&quot;C&quot;))) data frame: fancy matrices (more common) d &lt;- iris factor: more of a type of class than anything. This object is a factor with levels. class(d$Species) ## [1] &quot;factor&quot; levels(d$Species) ## [1] &quot;setosa&quot; &quot;versicolor&quot; &quot;virginica&quot; tibble: a special data frame from tidyverse For additional info, visit: https://swcarpentry.github.io/r-novice-inflammation/13-supp-data-structures/ 2.10 Comments Commenting your code is good practice. You can comment anything, but perhaps its most practical use is to leave instructions as to what the code, or section of code, is doing. Commenting is also great for when you dont want a certain part of your code to run. Below you see a function, kinda of a confusing one, where comments in each line help me (and other readers) understand what the function is doing. # My list my_list &lt;- c(&#39;Water0&#39;,&#39;Fire10&#39;,&#39;Ear899th&#39;, &#39;1Wind0&#39;) # Creating a function to remove numbers from my characters rem_num &lt;- function(list_of_words){ final_word_list &lt;- c() # creates empty list for (word in list_of_words){ # creating loop numberless &lt;- gsub(&#39;[[:digit:]]+&#39;, &#39;&#39;, word) # removing numbers final_word_list &lt;- c(final_word_list, numberless) # adding to a final list } print(final_word_list) # show list at the end } # Executing function rem_num(list_of_words = my_list) ## [1] &quot;Water&quot; &quot;Fire&quot; &quot;Earth&quot; &quot;Wind&quot; 2.11 Objects In R you can create objects. This can be any type of classes we discussed above. Your object can be a letter, a number, a word, a mix of letters and numbers, a dataframe, a vectors, a list, multiple lists, multiple data frames, you name it. If your object contains multiple things, it becomes a list. Objects, when created, appear in your Environment panel (top right). To create an object you must give it a name and then you use &lt;- followed by whatever you want to make an object. For instance: a &lt;- 1 b &lt;- &#39;Hi&#39; y &lt;- c(1, &#39;Hi&#39;, 3.5) y &lt;- c(5, 6) d &lt;- data.frame(&#39;Name&#39; = c(&#39;Ana&#39;,&#39;João&#39;,&#39;Pedro&#39;), &#39;Age&#39; = c(25, 40, 19)) 2.12 Combinations In R, as youve seen above, you can use combinations and attribute these combinations to a variable. # Create a combination with multiple items. c &lt;- c(1, &#39;Hi&#39;, 3.5) # Asking the mean of that set of items. mean(x = c(3, 4)) ## [1] 3.5 2.13 Subsetting When you have complex objects (not just a single entry object) you can use subset to select only a specific part of said object. a &lt;- c(&#39;apples&#39;,&#39;bananas&#39;,&#39;carrots&#39;,&#39;oranges&#39;,&#39;strawberry&#39;) a[1] # selects first entry ## [1] &quot;apples&quot; a[c(2,3)] # selects entries 2 and 3 ## [1] &quot;bananas&quot; &quot;carrots&quot; a[3:5] # selects entry 3 to entry 5 ## [1] &quot;carrots&quot; &quot;oranges&quot; &quot;strawberry&quot; 2.14 Ifs and Whiles if(), as well as while(), functions are really basic functions in programming languages, that allow you to iterate certain actions (i.e., perform an action multiple times). They are written, and mean, the following: If function if (condition){ perform_this # if true } else { perform_that # if false } While function while (condition){ perform_this } Here are just a few basic examples for you to get an idea. # First example if (3 &gt; 2){ print(&#39;True&#39;) } else { print(&#39;False&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;True&quot; # Second example my_list = c(&#39;orange&#39;, &#39;banana&#39;, &#39;apple&#39;) if (my_list[2] == &#39;apple&#39;){ print(&#39;The second item in the list is apple!&#39;) } else if (my_list[2] == &#39;orange&#39;){ print(&#39;The second item in the list is orange!&#39;) } else { print(&#39;The second item in the list must be banana!&#39;) } ## [1] &quot;The second item in the list must be banana!&quot; # Third example my_number = 0 while(my_number &lt; 5){ print(&#39;My current number is lower than 5&#39;) my_number &lt;- my_number + 1 } ## [1] &quot;My current number is lower than 5&quot; ## [1] &quot;My current number is lower than 5&quot; ## [1] &quot;My current number is lower than 5&quot; ## [1] &quot;My current number is lower than 5&quot; ## [1] &quot;My current number is lower than 5&quot; 2.15 Functions A function is a set of statements (commands) organized in a way to perform a task. R, for instance, already has a large number of in-built functions (for instance, mean(c(5, 10, 15)) is a function). The cool thing, however, is that, as with other programming languages, we can build our own function. The function takes a set of arguments and performs actions over that argument and output something (if we want). Its general structure is as follows: function_name &lt;- function(arg_1, arg_2, ...){ actions and commands } Here are a few examples. Lets say we want to create a function that tells us the square root of our input. square_function &lt;- function(number_to_be_squared){ final_number &lt;- (number_to_be_squared)^2 return(final_number) } # Now lets call the function square_function(number_to_be_squared = 9) ## [1] 81 Functions can also be called without arguments. arg_less &lt;- function(){ print(&#39;Just print this&#39;) } arg_less() ## [1] &quot;Just print this&quot; They can also have multiple inputs mult_fun &lt;- function(a, b, c){ output &lt;- a + b^2 + sqrt(c) print(output) } mult_fun(a = 1, b = 2, c = 5) ## [1] 7.236068 # Or simply # mult_fun(1, 2, 5) 2.16 Packages There are over 9000 packages. There are packages for nearly everything you want to do. These packages add new functions to R. You have base packages (already installed, but not loaded) and contributed packages (need to be installed and loaded). You can install the latter by using the following command install.packages('package_name') and call (load) packages with library(package_name). Most packages come from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network, which is basically Rs house), thus all you need to write is that. However, if some packages come from github for instance you need to install the packages devtools (install.packages('devtools')) then load it (library(devtools)) and finally use install_github(\"profile_name/repository\") to install the package. Usually if you google these packages they will have instructions on how to install them. You can also load and detach (remove package from your toolset for the time being) packages that you have already installed by going to the packages panel (bottom right) and searching and then selecting the package you want to load. In specific situations, particularly if you just want to use one function of a package, instead of loading the package you can simply write package_name::function_name(). R will just use that function from that package for that line in specific, but not load the package. 2.17 Shortcuts Here follows a list of useful shortcuts. Note that these are the ones I cant live without. There are plenty more, you just have to google them. Insert the pipe operator (%&gt;%): Command + Shift + M on a Mac, or Ctrl + Shift + M on Linux and Windows. Run the current line of code: Command + Enter on a Mac or Control + Enter on Linux and Windows. Run all lines of code: Command + A + Enter on a Mac or Control + A + Enter on Linux and Windows. Comment or un-comment lines: Command + Shift + C on a Mac or Control + Shift + C on Linux and Windows. Insert a new code chunk: Command + Option + I on a Mac or Control + Alt + I on a Linx and Windows. 2.18 Chunk settings When using R Notebooks or R Markdown, youll work with code chunks, as explained already. One important thing to know is that these chunks are adjustable, and these adjustments are both easy to make and can come in handy when compiling your code. These adjustments are made on the top part of the chunk that is between {}. So for instance, in a normal chunk you have the top portion as {r}. The first parameter tells you which language you are coding in, which in this case is R. If you are wondering, yes you can change the setting to code in other languages depending if you have them installed and configured with RStudio (e.g., {python}). Besides the language, you can change plenty of parameters. They have to be separated only by commas. Below are some brief examples of the ones I most commonly use (all of which, except fig.width and fig.height are defaulted to TRUE if you dont set them): include = FALSE : Runs the code, but does not include the code and the results in the finished file. echo = FALSE : Runs the code, but does not include the code in the finished file (but it includes the results). message = FALSE : Prevents messages generated by the code from appearing. warning = FALSE : Prevents warnings generated by the code from appearing. fig.width = \"width_in_pix\" and fig.height = \"height_in_pix\" : Set the width and height of the picture/plot. For more details go to: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html 2.19 Code completion When you begin to type, R will pop up suggestions as to what you want to write. These can be names of functions, variables or data frames for example. You can press TAB to select and let R auto-fill or just click on it with your mouse. 2.20 Other useful features Pressing CTRL + F will open up the find/replace menu at the top of your script screen. This can be immensely useful for you to find, and specially, replace lots of things within a portion (the portion you have selected) or the whole code (if you have no code selected). 2.21 Getting help To get help you have several options, which depend a lot on which type of help you need. If you want to know what arguments a functions requires, you can write its name and, and having your writing bar inside the () press TAB. If you need generic help about a function - what arguments go where, or, for instance, what does na.rm mean in that function - you can use the command ?function_name() in which function_name is the name of your function. This will pop up a help menu regarding that function that will appear on your help panel (bottom right). You can also click F1 while your cursor is over the function name. Depending on the function and its respective documentation this help can either be good or poor. If you need further help, or need help in problems that are not just concerned about a single function, you will want an internet connection. Having google searching skills will help lots with your R programming. A few notes and advices: - Search your problem using English language. - Search your problem in a generic way using proper searching language (dont write sentences, write the most relevant words of the problem). - If its an error just post the error message on google. Dont be afraid or let down if you need to use google to help you with stuff you learned but just dont remember. Its normal, trust me. 2.22 Further reading Need a more in-depth fundamentals of R?

He is lazy that way, and will not look everywhere on your computer for them. So, tell him by using the command setwd(). Reading the data Usually, when using R, you want to work with data. This data is usually already there and you want to open it in R. The good thing is that R can read just about anything (just google readfile type in R on google). Here I show you how to read some of the most common formats. Be sure to install the xlsx and haven packages to open Excell and SPSS files, respectively. Additionally, there are multiple ways to read the same file. Some will be built in R itself, others will require external packages. This is important to know because some functions, although working, may be outdated or just give you some sort of weird error. Maybe you can overcome this by using a different package. If you want to import/read an Excel file, just use: read.xlsx(file = 'example.xlsx', sheetName = 'page_1', header = TRUE) (xlsx package) If a text read.delim(file = 'example.txt', header = TRUE, sep = ',', dec = '.') CSV: read.csv(file = 'example.csv', header = TRUE, sep = ',', dec = '.') SAV (SPSS): read_sav(file = 'example.sav') (haven package) Managing your imported data To have your data in your environment, so that you can mess with it, you should assign your read command to a variable (object). Lets say you do the following mydata &lt;- read.delim(file = 'example.txt', header = TRUE, sep = ',', dec = '.'). Now, your mydata object is the dataframe containing that imported data set. mydata &lt;- read.csv(&#39;data/heart/heart_2020_cleaned.csv&#39;) Possible problems You may encounter several problems. Here are a few of the most common error messages you will face when importing data to R. the number of columns is superior to the data or the data is all jumbled. Perhaps one of the most common problems. This probably has to due with R separating columns where it shouldnt and making more columns than it should. You can fix this perhaps by making sure the sep command is specifying the exact separator of the file. It helps to open the file with excel, for instance, and check the separator and the decimals symbol (you dont want to be separating columns by the decimal symbol). For instance, sometimes R reads the .csv file (which means comma separated file) and you have commas as decimals (instead ; is the separator). This creates way to many columns that mismatch the number of headers present. cannot open file name_of_file.csv: No such file or directory. Make sure you are in the right working directory or are specifying the path correctly. There will surely be more problems, but you can find a way around them by using google. Checking the data After youve opened the data, you should take a peak at it. Theres several ways of doing this such as head(df) or some others Im not recalling at the moment. Lets see bellow. head(mydata) # you can add a &quot;,&quot; and say the number of rows you want to preview head(mydata, 10) # Or you can just View it all #View(mydata) 3.2 Opening multiple files Lets say you have a folder, lets assume is named data, and in there you have all your data files (files from each participant). Ideally, to analyze and view the data as a whole, you would want to import all of the data files, and then merge them into a big data file, containing all the participants (identified accordingly). Heres a snippet of code that would allow you to do that. Beware though, any file that matches the criteria (in this case .csv files) will be gathered from the folder (your working directory). Firstly, lets gather the names of the files in our directory that we want to import. # Setting our working directory setwd(&#39;C:/Users/fabio/OneDrive/My Things/Stats/Teaching/R_Book/data&#39;) # Empty list to list all txt files in folder list_of_files &lt;- list() # Searches for &quot;.csv&quot; files in the folder list_all_data &lt;- dir(pattern=&#39;.csv&#39;) # For each &quot;.csv&quot; file, append this file to a list that will contain all &quot;.csv&quot; file names. for (file in list_all_data){ list_of_files &lt;- c(list_of_files, file) cat(&#39;\\nFile processed:&#39;, file) # prints the file names } ## ## File processed: Participant_1.csv ## File processed: Participant_10.csv ## File processed: Participant_2.csv ## File processed: Participant_3.csv ## File processed: Participant_4.csv ## File processed: Participant_5.csv ## File processed: Participant_6.csv ## File processed: Participant_7.csv ## File processed: Participant_8.csv ## File processed: Participant_9.csv # Organizing the files list_of_files &lt;- as.character(list_of_files) # To character #list_of_files &lt;- mixedsort(sort(list_of_files)) # Sorting them by name list_of_files &lt;- as.list(list_of_files) # Transforming it to list # How many files were processed? cat(&#39;\\nTotal number of files processed:&#39;, length(unlist(list_of_files))) ## ## Total number of files processed: 10 Then we need to create a function that iterates over all of this file names. It will need to import each file (by their name) and append them to a general dataframe. # Setting our working directory setwd(&#39;C:/Users/fabio/OneDrive/My Things/Stats/Teaching/R_Book/data&#39;) # Create an empty dataframe where all data will be stored df_all &lt;- data.frame() # Create a simple reading function for every element in a list import_data &lt;- function(file_name){ for (name in file_name){ # for every name in that list df &lt;- read.csv(name, header=TRUE, encoding = &#39;utf-8&#39;, sep=&#39;,&#39;) # read that name and assign it to &quot;df&quot; df_all &lt;- rbind(df_all, df) # add &quot;df&quot; to that list } df_all &lt;&lt;- df_all # Makes this object available globally } # Running function import_data(file_name = list_of_files) 3.3 Merging You can join two data frames either by rows or by columns. Typically, you use rows when you try too join more data to your current data frame. To do so, you can use rbind(). # Splitting the data by rows d1 &lt;- USArrests[1:20, ] d2 &lt;- USArrests[21:nrow(USArrests), ] # Creating a new dataframe with the merged data merged_d &lt;- rbind(d1, d2) More frequently, perhaps, you want to join complementary information (more variables) to your preexisting data. To do so, you can use cbind(). # Splitting the data by columns d1 &lt;- USArrests[, c(1,2)] d2 &lt;- USArrests[, c(3,4)] # Creating a new dataframe with the merged data merged_d &lt;- cbind(d1, d2) However, this above code only works correctly (as intended) if your data is perfectly lined up. For instance, rbind() will work if you have the same number of variables (columns), with the same names and in the same positions. So you need to be sure this is the case before you merge the data frames. As for cbind() on the other hand, it requires you to have the same number of entire (rows) and for these to be arranged in the same manner (otherwise your info would mismatch). You can try and order things correctly, but you can easily place some information incorrectly. To circumvent this, you can use merge(). In this command you only have to specify the IDs (e.g., sample_ID or person_ID) that allow R to connect the information in the right place. # Preparing the data d &lt;- USArrests d$State &lt;- rownames(d) rownames(d) &lt;- NULL d &lt;- d[, c(5,3,1,2,4)] # Creating two separate dataframes d1 &lt;- d[, c(1:2)] d2 &lt;- d[, c(1, 3:5)] # Joining dataframes by the &quot;State&quot; column d_all &lt;- merge(x = d1, y = d2, by = &#39;State&#39;) Now lets say the data frames werent perfectly matched. For instance lets say we remove Alabama from d1. d1 &lt;- d1[-1, ] # Removing Alabama # Merging d_all &lt;- merge(x = d1, y = d2, by = &#39;State&#39;) # adds only what matches d_all &lt;- merge(x = d1, y = d2, by = &#39;State&#39;, all = TRUE) # adds everything head(d_all) ## State UrbanPop Murder Assault Rape ## 1 Alabama NA 13.2 236 21.2 ## 2 Alaska 48 10.0 263 44.5 ## 3 Arizona 80 8.1 294 31.0 ## 4 Arkansas 50 8.8 190 19.5 ## 5 California 91 9.0 276 40.6 ## 6 Colorado 78 7.9 204 38.7 Now you check the d_all you will see that there is no Alabama. You can use the parameter all or all.x or all.y to indicate if you want all of the rows in the data frames (either all or just the x or y data frames, respectively) to be added to the final data frame. If so, as you can see, Alabama is also imported, even thought there is NA in the in one of the fields (because even though its not in d1, it is in the d2 data frame). There are other parameters that can be tweaked for more specific scenarios, just run ?merge() to explore the function and its parameters. 3.4 Exporting Aside from importing, sometimes we also want to export the files we created/modified in R. We can do this with several commands, but perhaps the simpler ones are: write.table(x = df, file = 'namewewant.txt', sep = ',', dec = '.') This tells R to export the df dataframe, to a not existing file with a name namewewant.txt, that is separated by commas and has . for decimal points. We can also export to an existing data file, and ask for append = TRUE, thus appending our data to the data already existing in that file. Be sure thought, that this data has the same structure (e.g., number of columns, position of the columns). We can also do the same thing as above, but instead create a .csv file. write.csv(x = df, file = 'namewewant.csv') As an example, lets export the dataframe we created in the chunks above. Note that if we dont specify the path along with the name of the file to be created, R will save the file to the current working directory. # Tells the path I want to export to. path = &#39;C:/Users/fabio/OneDrive/My Things/Stats/Teaching/R_Book/&#39; # Merges the path with the file name I want to give it. filename &lt;- paste(path, &#39;some_data.csv&#39;, sep = &#39;&#39;) # Export it write.csv(x = df_all, file = filename) 3.5 Special cases in R In R variables, but more specifically on data frames, you can encounter the following default symbols: NA: Not Available (i.e., missing value) NaN: Not a Number (e.g., 0/0) Inf e -Inf: Infinity These are special categories of values and can mess up your transformations and functions. We will talk about them more in the next chapter. 3.6 Manipulating the data in dataframes Now, in R you can manage your dataframe as you please. You can do anything. And I truly mean anything. Anything you can do in Excel and then some. 3.6.1 Subsetting a dataframe Subsetting is a very important skill that you should try to master. It allows you to select only the portions of your data frame that you want. This is vital for any type of data manipulation and cleaning you try to accomplish. The symbols $ lets you subset (select) columns of a dataframe really easily, if you just want a column. df &lt;- iris df$Sepal.Length ## [1] 5.1 4.9 4.7 4.6 5.0 5.4 4.6 5.0 4.4 4.9 5.4 4.8 4.8 4.3 5.8 5.7 5.4 5.1 ## [19] 5.7 5.1 5.4 5.1 4.6 5.1 4.8 5.0 5.0 5.2 5.2 4.7 4.8 5.4 5.2 5.5 4.9 5.0 ## [37] 5.5 4.9 4.4 5.1 5.0 4.5 4.4 5.0 5.1 4.8 5.1 4.6 5.3 5.0 7.0 6.4 6.9 5.5 ## [55] 6.5 5.7 6.3 4.9 6.6 5.2 5.0 5.9 6.0 6.1 5.6 6.7 5.6 5.8 6.2 5.6 5.9 6.1 ## [73] 6.3 6.1 6.4 6.6 6.8 6.7 6.0 5.7 5.5 5.5 5.8 6.0 5.4 6.0 6.7 6.3 5.6 5.5 ## [91] 5.5 6.1 5.8 5.0 5.6 5.7 5.7 6.2 5.1 5.7 6.3 5.8 7.1 6.3 6.5 7.6 4.9 7.3 ## [109] 6.7 7.2 6.5 6.4 6.8 5.7 5.8 6.4 6.5 7.7 7.7 6.0 6.9 5.6 7.7 6.3 6.7 7.2 ## [127] 6.2 6.1 6.4 7.2 7.4 7.9 6.4 6.3 6.1 7.7 6.3 6.4 6.0 6.9 6.7 6.9 5.8 6.8 ## [145] 6.7 6.7 6.3 6.5 6.2 5.9 If you want more columns, you can use [].

Just visit: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DataEditR/vignettes/DataEditR.html Although I would argue against it, since this doesnt make your R code easy to re-execute. 3.6.4 Tidyverse &amp; Pipes Before presenting the following commands below, we should talk quickly about tidyverse and pipes. Tidyverse, as the name implies Tidy + [Uni]verse is a big package that contains more packages. All of these packages are designed for data science. These are: dplyr: Basic grammar for data manipulation (also responsible for pipes). ggplot2: Used to create all sorts of graphics. forcats: Facilitates functional programming for data science (e.g., can replace loops with maps, a simpler command) tibble: Better dataframe, making it cleaner and more efficient (although they are mostly interchangeable). readr: Reads data of several types in a smart manner (including csv). stringr: Makes working with string information easy. tidyr: Helps to tidy data presentation. purr: Makes handling factors (categorical variables) easier. library(tidyverse) ## -- Attaching packages --------------------------------------- tidyverse 1.3.1 -- ## v ggplot2 3.3.6 v purrr 0.3.4 ## v tibble 3.1.5 v dplyr 1.0.8 ## v tidyr 1.2.0 v stringr 1.4.0 ## v readr 2.1.2 v forcats 0.5.1 ## Warning: package &#39;ggplot2&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 ## Warning: package &#39;tidyr&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 ## Warning: package &#39;readr&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 ## Warning: package &#39;dplyr&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 ## -- Conflicts ------------------------------------------ tidyverse_conflicts() -- ## x dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter() ## x dplyr::lag() masks stats::lag() As you can see by the output you get when you load it, it basically loads them all making in a single line. Now onto pipes. Basically this allow you to chain your commands. It comes from the dplyr or magritrr packages. It can be read as follows: WITH THIS %&gt;% EXECUTE THIS %&gt;% THEN EXECUTE THIS %&gt;% THEN THIS So instead of this: object &lt;- function_1(object) object &lt;- function_2(object) object &lt;- function_3(object) # or object &lt;- function_3(function_2(function_1(object))) We can instead have this object %&gt;% function_1() %&gt;% function_2() %&gt;% function_3() Here are two concrete examples: With 4+4, add another 4. 4+4 %&gt;% +4 With my dataframe (df), select its column1 and then calculate the mean. df %&gt;% select(column1) %&gt;% mean() Remember, you can call this pipe command by pressing CTRL &amp; SHIFT + M in Windows and Command + Shift + M on a Mac. You may find it weird at first, but trust me, it will become intuitive in no time. If you want a better tutorial on pipes just visit the following link: https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pipe-r-tutorial 3.6.5 Filtering Now, lets say we want to filter the dataframe. That is, we want to select our data based on some criteria. df &lt;- iris #We can filter by Species. In this case we are only selecting &quot;setosa&quot;. df %&gt;% filter(Species == &#39;setosa&#39;) # Or we can select &quot;everything but&quot;. df %&gt;% filter(Species != &#39;setosa&#39;) # And we can even select multiple things df %&gt;% filter(Species != &#39;setosa&#39; &amp; Sepal.Length &gt; 7.5) # We can also select one &quot;OR&quot; the other df %&gt;% filter(Species != &#39;setosa&#39; | Sepal.Length &gt; 7.5) # We can remove NAs df %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Species)) 3.6.6 Arranging We can arrange the dataframe as we wish. We can sort by just 1 column or more. In the latter case the second, third and so on variables will break the ties. Missing values are sorted to the end. # It defaults as ascending df %&gt;% arrange(Sepal.Length) # We can make it descending: df %&gt;% arrange(desc(Sepal.Length)) 3.6.7 Selecting Another useful trick is to select columns. With this command we can select the columns we want, or do not want. # Selecting Sepal.Lenght and Species columns df %&gt;% select(Sepal.Length, Species) # We can also select multiple columns by saying from x to y: df %&gt;% select(Sepal.Length:Species) # To select everything but: df %&gt;% select(-c(Sepal.Length, Species)) 3.6.8 Mutating To create new columns (or modify existing ones), we can use mutate. This a versatile command that allows you to do several things. Here are a bunch of examples: # Create a new column with just the string &quot;word&quot; on it. df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(WordColumn = &#39;word&#39;) # Create a combination of two columns df %&gt;% mutate(TwoColsTogether = paste(Species, WordColumn)) # Create the sum of two columns df %&gt;% mutate(SumOfCols = Petal.Length + Petal.Width) # Among others df %&gt;% mutate(Times100 = Petal.Length*100) df %&gt;% mutate(DividedBy2 = Petal.Width/2) 3.6.9 Ifelse ifelse() is a base function of R (not from tidyverse, altough you have if_else() from tidyverse which works and does exactly the same thing), but it fits quite well with its workflow. Specifically it fits quite well with the mutate() command. What it basically says is: if THIS_CONDITION_IS_MET then DO_CASE_1 otherwise DO_CASE_2. The function will look like this: ifelse(THIS_CONDITION_IS_MET, DO_CASE_1, DO_CASE_2). Lets look at some examples below. df &lt;- iris # Replacing for just 1 condition. df %&gt;% mutate(SpeciesAlt = ifelse(Species == &#39;setosa&#39;, &#39;Specie1&#39;, Species)) ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species SpeciesAlt ##

The first one, in itself, does not do anything. It is meant to be followed by the latter. In the group_by(variables) command you tell R on which variables you want to group your data by specifying the column that contains this (or these) variable(s). In the example below the only column that makes sense grouping by is Species. By telling R to group with species, the next command summarise() give a summary output for each category of the Species column. Lets look at the examples that follow. df &lt;- iris # Summarising mean Sepal.length by species df %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% # Grouping by this variable summarise(Mean_By_Species = mean(Sepal.Length)) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## Species Mean_By_Species ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 setosa 5.01 ## 2 versicolor 5.94 ## 3 virginica 6.59 You can group by more than one factor and ask for other summaries, such as median, sd, and other basic operations. For instance: df %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise(count = n()) # Gives you the number of entries in each group ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## Species count ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 setosa 50 ## 2 versicolor 50 ## 3 virginica 50 You can then build operations on top of your summaries (like mutations or plots) df %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise(Mean_Length = mean(Sepal.Length)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(Species, Mean_Length)) + geom_col() 3.6.11 Changing Format (Wide/Long) There are two types of ways that the data can be structured in. These ways are important for many reasons, not just for the way they look. Certain analysis, commands or functions used in R prefer (or rather mandate) that the data is in a specific format. This format can be either wide or long. In the wide format each each variable level has a column. Lets say we are looking at how people rate pictures of happy, angry and neutral people in terms of good looks on a rating of 0-10. If we were to have the data in a wide format, we would have a data frame with (aside from columns related to the ID of the participant and so forth) 3 columns. One, labeled Ratings_Happy for instance, that would have all the ratings given by each participant to the happy faces, another with the ratings given to the angry faces and another to the neutral faces. It should look something like this: However, if we were to have the data in long format, we would instead have just have two columns (aside from the Participant ID and other information columns you might want). One column, labeled Facial_Expression for instance, would have either Happy, Angry or Neutral. The other column, labeled Rating, would have the rating given to the face. Since all of the participants rated every condition, each participant would have 3 entries in the dataframe (hence making it longer). It should look something like this: This is quite simple to do actually. The commands we will be using are pivot_wider and pivot_longer and they are quite intuitive. Lets work through this example. Lets first say we want to transform data frame from long to wide. df_long &lt;- data.frame(Participant_ID = rep(1:5,each=3), Facial_Expression = rep(c(&#39;Happy&#39;,&#39;Angry&#39;,&#39;Neutral&#39;), 5), Ratings = c(6,4,2,6,4,7,6,5,7,5,8,6,5,8,5)) # Transforming df_wide &lt;- df_long %&gt;% pivot_wider(id_cols = Participant_ID, # Condition that identifies the grouping (ID) factor of each entry. names_from = Facial_Expression, # Where to find our future column names values_from = Ratings) # Where are the values that will fill those columns head(df_wide) ## # A tibble: 5 x 4 ## Participant_ID Happy Angry Neutral ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 6 4 2 ## 2 2 6 4 7 ## 3 3 6 5 7 ## 4 4 5 8 6 ## 5 5 5 8 5 Now doing the reverse, that is, turning the data from the current wide format and making it longer again. df_long &lt;- df_wide %&gt;% pivot_longer(cols = c(&#39;Happy&#39;,&#39;Angry&#39;,&#39;Neutral&#39;), # Columns to turn into long names_to = &#39;Facial_Expression&#39;, # What will the column with the labels be called values_to = &#39;Ratings&#39;) # What will the column with the values be called head(df_long) ## # A tibble: 6 x 3 ## Participant_ID Facial_Expression Ratings ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 1 Happy 6 ## 2 1 Angry 4 ## 3 1 Neutral 2 ## 4 2 Happy 6 ## 5 2 Angry 4 ## 6 2 Neutral 7 3.6.12 Missing Values We have several ways of dealing with missing values NA (which, if you forget already, means Not Available). We can remove them, or omit them, depending on the situation. The important thing to note is that you should be aware if your dataframe contains NA values, since these might provide misleading results, or simple provide error messages. For instance, if you ask the mean of a column that contains just one NA, the result will be NA. You can either specify na.rm = TRUE on the command (if the specific command allows you to do so), or just remove the NA values prior to running the command. First lets learn how to check for missing values. There are several ways. Here are a few table(is.na(df)) # tells you how many data points are NAs (TRUE) or not (FALSE) in the whole dataframe. ## ## FALSE ## 750 colSums(is.na(df)) # tells you more specifically the number of NAs per column in your dataframe ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## 0 0 0 0 0 which(colSums(is.na(df))&gt;0) # just tells you exactly the ones that have NAs (and how many) ## named integer(0) df[!complete.cases(df),] # tells you the whole row that has an NA value in it. ## [1] Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## &lt;0 rows&gt; (or 0-length row.names) df$Sepal.Length &lt;- as.numeric(df$Sepal.Length) # Asking a mean with NA values df %&gt;% summarise(Mean = mean(Sepal.Length)) ## Mean ## 1 NA # Removing NAs when asking the mean df %&gt;% summarise(Mean = mean(Sepal.Length, na.rm=TRUE)) ## Mean ## 1 5.843333 # Removing NAs then asking for the mean df %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Sepal.Length)) %&gt;% summarise(Mean = mean(Sepal.Length)) ## Mean ## 1 5.843333 We can remove these NA rows or substitute them. # Replacing NA with 0 df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(Sepal.Length = ifelse(is.na(Sepal.Length), 0, Sepal.Length)) # Removing df &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(!is.na(Sepal.Length)) # or remove all NA rows df &lt;- na.omit(df) 3.6.13 Counts Already mentioned above. Gives you the number of entries. # Gives you the number per category of Species df %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% summarise(count = n()) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## Species count ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 setosa 51 ## 2 versicolor 50 ## 3 virginica 50 # Counts the total number of entries df %&gt;% select(Species) %&gt;% count() ## n ## 1 151 3.6.14 Ungrouping Lastly, you can use ungroup() in a pipe to remove the grouping that youve did, if you want to execute commands over the ungrouped data. This is very rarely used, at least by me. However, in certain cases it might be useful. Heres an example, where I want to center the variable Sepal.Length, but I want to do so considering the species it belongs to. df %&gt;% group_by(Species) %&gt;% # grouping by species mutate(Sepal.Width = as.numeric(Sepal.Width), Speal.Length = as.numeric(Sepal.Length)) %&gt;% mutate(MeanPerSpecie = mean(Sepal.Width), # creates mean by species CenteredWidth = Sepal.Width - mean(Sepal.Width)) %&gt;% # subtracts the mean (of the corresponding specie). select(Species, Sepal.Width, MeanPerSpecie, CenteredWidth) %&gt;% ungroup() # remove grouping in case i want to do more mutates, but now NOT considering the groups of species. ## # A tibble: 151 x 4 ## Species Sepal.Width MeanPerSpecie CenteredWidth ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 setosa 3.5 3.40 0.0980 ## 2 setosa 3 3.40 -0.402 ## 3 setosa 3.2 3.40 -0.202 ## 4 setosa 3.1 3.40 -0.302 ## 5 setosa 3.6 3.40 0.198 ## 6 setosa 3.9 3.40 0.498 ## 7 setosa 3.4 3.40 -0.00196 ## 8 setosa 3.4 3.40 -0.00196 ## 9 setosa 2.9 3.40 -0.502 ## 10 setosa 3.1 3.40 -0.302 ## # ... with 141 more rows 3.6.15 Strings/Characters Sometimes we want to work on strings/characters. We may want to replace strings, alter them in some way, split them into different columns, etc. So here I will introduce a few examples of what we can do to strings in R. For instance lets say we want to find a pattern of a string in a column of a dataframe in R. For that we will use the grep family of functions which is built-in in R. # We can either find the rows on which this pattern appear grep(&#39;set&#39;, df$Species) # We can pull the string in which this pattern appears grep(&#39;set&#39;, df$Species, value = TRUE) # Or return a TRUE or FALSE per row grepl(&#39;set&#39;, df$Species) # the &quot;l&quot; after grep stands for logic (i.e., TRUE/FALSE) # We can find how many entries with that pattern are present sum(grepl(&#39;set&#39;, df$Species)) # We can substitute a pattern directly in the dataframe sub(&#39;set&#39;, &#39;Set&#39;, df$Species) There are additional commands within this family of functions that will allow you to extract, find or substitute exactly what you want and obeying each condition you might want. For that just look into: https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/grep Another relevant package used to deal with strings is stringr, which comes with the tidyverse. Here Ill showing some brief examples of what you can do with it, although you can do much more, and you should check its website: https://stringr.tidyverse.org/ # Just preparing the df df2 &lt;- mtcars df2$CarName &lt;- rownames(mtcars) rownames(df2) &lt;- NULL # StringR df2 %&gt;% mutate(CarName = str_replace(CarName, &#39;Merc&#39;, &#39;Mercedes&#39;)) ## mpg cyl disp hp drat wt qsec vs am gear carb CarName ## 1 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 ## 2 21.0 6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02 0 1 4 4 Mazda RX4 Wag ## 3 22.8 4 108.0 93 3.85 2.320 18.61 1 1 4 1 Datsun 710 ## 4 21.4 6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44 1 0 3 1 Hornet 4 Drive ## 5 18.7 8 360.0 175 3.15 3.440 17.02 0 0 3 2 Hornet Sportabout ## 6 18.1 6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22 1 0 3 1 Valiant ## 7 14.3 8 360.0 245 3.21 3.570 15.84 0 0 3 4 Duster 360 ## 8 24.4 4 146.7 62 3.69 3.190 20.00 1 0 4 2 Mercedes 240D ## 9 22.8 4 140.8 95 3.92 3.150 22.90 1 0 4 2 Mercedes 230 ## 10 19.2 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30 1 0 4 4 Mercedes 280 ## 11 17.8 6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90 1 0 4 4 Mercedes 280C ## 12 16.4 8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40 0 0 3 3 Mercedes 450SE ## 13 17.3 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.730 17.60 0 0 3 3 Mercedes 450SL ## 14 15.2 8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00 0 0 3 3 Mercedes 450SLC ## 15 10.4 8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98 0 0 3 4 Cadillac Fleetwood ## 16 10.4 8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82 0 0 3 4 Lincoln Continental ## 17 14.7 8 440.0 230 3.23 5.345 17.42 0 0 3 4 Chrysler Imperial ## 18 32.4 4 78.7 66 4.08 2.200 19.47 1 1 4 1 Fiat 128 ## 19 30.4 4 75.7 52 4.93 1.615 18.52 1 1 4 2 Honda Civic ## 20 33.9 4 71.1 65 4.22 1.835 19.90 1 1 4 1 Toyota Corolla ## 21 21.5 4 120.1 97 3.70 2.465 20.01 1 0 3 1 Toyota Corona ## 22 15.5 8 318.0 150 2.76 3.520 16.87 0 0 3 2 Dodge Challenger ## 23 15.2 8 304.0 150 3.15 3.435 17.30 0 0 3 2 AMC Javelin ## 24 13.3 8 350.0 245 3.73 3.840 15.41 0 0 3 4 Camaro Z28 ## 25 19.2 8 400.0 175 3.08 3.845 17.05 0 0 3 2 Pontiac Firebird ## 26 27.3 4 79.0 66 4.08 1.935 18.90 1 1 4 1 Fiat X1-9 ## 27 26.0 4 120.3 91 4.43 2.140 16.70 0 1 5 2 Porsche 914-2 ## 28 30.4 4 95.1 113 3.77 1.513 16.90 1 1 5 2 Lotus Europa ## 29 15.8 8 351.0 264 4.22 3.170 14.50 0 1 5 4 Ford Pantera L ## 30 19.7 6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50 0 1 5 6 Ferrari Dino ## 31 15.0 8 301.0 335 3.54 3.570 14.60 0 1 5 8 Maserati Bora ## 32 21.4 4 121.0 109 4.11 2.780 18.60 1 1 4 2 Volvo 142E 3.6.16 Splits We can also split a dataframe into multiple ones, by using group_split() or split(). They work and do the same. The only difference is that the former comes with the tidyverse and also just works a bit better with the pipes. For instance, lets split the dataframe by species. df %&gt;% group_split(Species) ## &lt;list_of&lt; ## tbl_df&lt; ## Sepal.Length: double ## Sepal.Width : character ## Petal.Length: character ## Petal.Width : character ## Species : factor&lt;fb977&gt; ## &gt; ## &gt;[3]&gt; ## [[1]] ## # A tibble: 51 x 5 ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 2 4.9 3 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa ## 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 5 5 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa ## 7 4.6 3.4 1.4 0.3 setosa ## 8 5 3.4 1.5 0.2 setosa ## 9 4.4 2.9 1.4 0.2 setosa ## 10 4.9 3.1 1.5 0.1 setosa ## # ... with 41 more rows ## ## [[2]] ## # A tibble: 50 x 5 ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 7 3.2 4.7 1.4 versicolor ## 2 6.4 3.2 4.5 1.5 versicolor ## 3 6.9 3.1 4.9 1.5 versicolor ## 4 5.5 2.3 4 1.3 versicolor ## 5 6.5 2.8 4.6 1.5 versicolor ## 6 5.7 2.8 4.5 1.3 versicolor ## 7 6.3 3.3 4.7 1.6 versicolor ## 8 4.9 2.4 3.3 1 versicolor ## 9 6.6 2.9 4.6 1.3 versicolor ## 10 5.2 2.7 3.9 1.4 versicolor ## # ... with 40 more rows ## ## [[3]] ## # A tibble: 50 x 5 ## Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;fct&gt; ## 1 6.3 3.3 6 2.5 virginica ## 2 5.8 2.7 5.1 1.9 virginica ## 3 7.1 3 5.9 2.1 virginica ## 4 6.3 2.9 5.6 1.8 virginica ## 5 6.5 3 5.8 2.2 virginica ## 6 7.6 3 6.6 2.1 virginica ## 7 4.9 2.5 4.5 1.7 virginica ## 8 7.3 2.9 6.3 1.8 virginica ## 9 6.7 2.5 5.8 1.8 virginica ## 10 7.2 3.6 6.1 2.5 virginica ## # ... with 40 more rows 3.6.17 Mapping Mapping is quite useful. It allows you to map a function to a certain output. For instance, if you first need to split the dataframe, then perform a correlation test, you can easily do this altogether. df %&gt;% mutate(Sepal.Length = as.numeric(Sepal.Length), # turning these columns to numeric Sepal.Width = as.numeric(Sepal.Width)) %&gt;% group_split(Species) %&gt;% # split by pictures map(~ cor.test(.$Sepal.Length, .$Sepal.Width)) ## [[1]] ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: .$Sepal.Length and .$Sepal.Width ## t = 6.7473, df = 49, p-value = 1.634e-08 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.5173516 0.8139116 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.6939905 ## ## ## [[2]] ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: .$Sepal.Length and .$Sepal.Width ## t = 4.2839, df = 48, p-value = 8.772e-05 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2900175 0.7015599 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.5259107 ## ## ## [[3]] ## ## Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation ## ## data: .$Sepal.Length and .$Sepal.Width ## t = 3.5619, df = 48, p-value = 0.0008435 ## alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 ## 95 percent confidence interval: ## 0.2049657 0.6525292 ## sample estimates: ## cor ## 0.4572278 We can see it more clearly in this dataframe. mtcars %&gt;% split(.$cyl) %&gt;% map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x)) %&gt;% map_dfr(~ as.data.frame(t(as.matrix(coef(.))))) # returns the result in a dataframe format ## (Intercept) wt ## 1 39.57120 -5.647025 ## 2 28.40884 -2.780106 ## 3 23.86803 -2.192438 3.7 End "],["exploratory-data-analysis-eda.html", "Chapter 4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 4.1 Loading data 4.2 Checking data 4.3 Cleaning 4.4 Summarising 4.5 Plots 4.6 End", " Chapter 4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA for short) we will want to explore our data. We usually start by getting summaries and plots that broadly summarise how our data is structured. We then proceed to more specific exploration of what variables interest us. There is no right way of doing EDA, and everyone does EDA slightly different. What matters in the end is that this part of your data analysis gives you a good glimpse about your data and potential targets to further explore and analyze. And of course, this will be a good time to put your plotting skills to test, and with R, you can do pretty much anything and, again, I truly mean anything. What is the data we will be working with? The data exemplified here comes from Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network. It contains information about 344 penguins, across 3 different species of penguins, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. Horst AM, Hill AP, Gorman KB (2020). palmerpenguins: Palmer Archipelago (Antarctica) penguin data. R package version 0.1.0. https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/ Now lets look at the data We can either show the first rows (or last rows) to get a general view on what the columns are and what the values associated with each columns are, or we can View the entire dataframe. Additionally we can also use several commands to provide us some more general info about the dataframe itself. 4.1 Loading data penguins_raw &lt;- palmerpenguins::penguins_raw head(penguins_raw) ## # A tibble: 6 x 17 ## studyName `Sample Number` Species Region Island Stage `Individual ID` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 PAL0708 1 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N1A1 ## 2 PAL0708 2 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N1A2 ## 3 PAL0708 3 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N2A1 ## 4 PAL0708 4 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N2A2 ## 5 PAL0708 5 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N3A1 ## 6 PAL0708 6 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N3A2 ## # ... with 10 more variables: `Clutch Completion` &lt;chr&gt;, `Date Egg` &lt;date&gt;, ## # `Culmen Length (mm)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Culmen Depth (mm)` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `Flipper Length (mm)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Body Mass (g)` &lt;dbl&gt;, Sex &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `Delta 15 N (o/oo)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Delta 13 C (o/oo)` &lt;dbl&gt;, Comments &lt;chr&gt; # Use tails() if you want to see the last rows The str() command gives us some detail into the class of each column of the data frame, its length, its values, among others.

Most of the tools you need were already introduced in Chapter 2, but you will learn some new ones here along the way. First though, lets get familiarized with the data by reading its description. So a brief intro to this data. This data measures structural size of adult male and female Adélie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) nesting along the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station. It has 17 columns, namely: studyName: Sampling expedition from which data were collected, generated, etc. Sample Number: an integer denoting the continuous numbering sequence for each sample Species: a character string denoting the penguin species Region: a character string denoting the region of Palmer LTER sampling grid Island: a character string denoting the island near Palmer Station where samples were collected Stage: a character string denoting reproductive stage at sampling Individual ID: a character string denoting the unique ID for each individual in dataset Clutch Completion: a character string denoting if the study nest observed with a full clutch, i.e., 2 eggs Date Egg: a date denoting the date study nest observed with 1 egg (sampled) Culmen Length: a number denoting the length of the dorsal ridge of a birds bill (millimeters) Culmen Depth: a number denoting the depth of the dorsal ridge of a birds bill (millimeters) Flipper Length: an integer denoting the length penguin flipper (millimeters) Body Mass: an integer denoting the penguin body mass (grams) Sex: a character string denoting the sex of an animal Delta 15 N: a number denoting the measure of the ratio of stable isotopes 15N:14N Delta 13 C: a number denoting the measure of the ratio of stable isotopes 13C:12C Comments: a character string with text providing additional relevant information for data There is also a subsetted (cleaner) version with just the species, island, size (flipper length, body mass, bill dimensions) and sex variables. We will, however, work with the raw version and transform it ourselves making it cleaner and easier to explore and gather some initial insights about the data. head(penguins_raw) ## # A tibble: 6 x 17 ## studyName `Sample Number` Species Region Island Stage `Individual ID` ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 PAL0708 1 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N1A1 ## 2 PAL0708 2 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N1A2 ## 3 PAL0708 3 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N2A1 ## 4 PAL0708 4 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N2A2 ## 5 PAL0708 5 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N3A1 ## 6 PAL0708 6 Adelie Penguin ~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N3A2 ## # ... with 10 more variables: `Clutch Completion` &lt;chr&gt;, `Date Egg` &lt;date&gt;, ## # `Culmen Length (mm)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Culmen Depth (mm)` &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # `Flipper Length (mm)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Body Mass (g)` &lt;dbl&gt;, Sex &lt;chr&gt;, ## # `Delta 15 N (o/oo)` &lt;dbl&gt;, `Delta 13 C (o/oo)` &lt;dbl&gt;, Comments &lt;chr&gt; 4.3 Cleaning 4.3.1 Cleaning col. names So first off, we might want to clean the data. One thing we often do is rename variables (in this case columns). We can do so simply with the use of the rename() function from dplyr. rename(): changes the names of individual variables using new_name = old_name syntax. rename_with(): renames columns using a function. # Lets say I want to rename &quot;Individual ID&quot; to &quot;ID&quot;. penguins &lt;- penguins_raw %&gt;% rename(&#39;ID&#39; = &#39;Individual ID&#39;) Now we might want to make every column, except ID, lower case, substitute spaces with _ and remove (). penguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;% rename_with(tolower) %&gt;% # lower-case every column rename_with(toupper, starts_with(&#39;ID&#39;)) %&gt;% # up-case column starting with &quot;ID&quot; rename_with(~gsub(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% # subs every space (&quot; &quot;) with no space (&quot;_&quot;) rename_with(~gsub(&quot;\\\\(&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% #removes every &quot;(&quot; rename_with(~gsub(&quot;\\\\)&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% # removes every &quot;)&quot; rename_with(~gsub(&quot;/&quot; ,&quot;&quot;, .x)) # removes / We could also skip a few things and be less specific, but instead use only the following function from the janitor package penguins %&gt;% janitor::clean_names() ## # A tibble: 344 x 17 ## studyname sample_number species region island stage id clutch_completi~ ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 PAL0708 1 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N1A1 Yes ## 2 PAL0708 2 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N1A2 Yes ## 3 PAL0708 3 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N2A1 Yes ## 4 PAL0708 4 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N2A2 Yes ## 5 PAL0708 5 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N3A1 Yes ## 6 PAL0708 6 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N3A2 Yes ## 7 PAL0708 7 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N4A1 No ## 8 PAL0708 8 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N4A2 No ## 9 PAL0708 9 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N5A1 Yes ## 10 PAL0708 10 Adelie Pe~ Anvers Torge~ Adul~ N5A2 Yes ## # ... with 334 more rows, and 9 more variables: date_egg &lt;date&gt;, ## # culmen_length_mm &lt;dbl&gt;, culmen_depth_mm &lt;dbl&gt;, flipper_length_mm &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # body_mass_g &lt;dbl&gt;, sex &lt;chr&gt;, delta_15_n_ooo &lt;dbl&gt;, delta_13_c_ooo &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # comments &lt;chr&gt; 4.3.2 Date One interesting and somewhat difficult (sometimes) parameter to adjust is turning a column that is often a character to a date format. In this case is simple, but I give you some examples below for you to work your way through other types of transformations. penguins$date_egg &lt;- as.Date(penguins$date_egg) Now here are other examples, aside from this data. characters &lt;- c(&quot;1jan1960&quot;, &quot;2jan1960&quot;, &quot;31mar1960&quot;, &quot;30jul1960&quot;) dates &lt;- as.Date(characters, &quot;%d%b%Y&quot;) dates ## [1] &quot;1960-01-01&quot; &quot;1960-01-02&quot; &quot;1960-03-31&quot; &quot;1960-07-30&quot; characters &lt;- c(&quot;02/27/92&quot;, &quot;02/27/92&quot;, &quot;01/14/92&quot;, &quot;02/28/92&quot;, &quot;02/01/92&quot;) dates &lt;- as.Date(characters, &quot;%m/%d/%y&quot;) dates ## [1] &quot;1992-02-27&quot; &quot;1992-02-27&quot; &quot;1992-01-14&quot; &quot;1992-02-28&quot; &quot;1992-02-01&quot; Check also these link for better examples. https://www.r-bloggers.com/2013/08/date-formats-in-r/ 4.3.3 Cleaning some columns In particular, I want to remove the species latin name from the species column as well as the parenthesis. Now this may seem simple, but messing with characters is one of those things that having an internet connection is key, since base commands, in my opinion, are not at all clear or simple. The command below simple means replace the species column with a new one (with the same name), but in this one replace all the text that is between the parenthesis (including the parenthesis themselves) \" *\\\\(.*?\\\\) *\" and replace by nothing \"\". penguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;% mutate(species = gsub(&quot; *\\\\(.*?\\\\) *&quot;, &quot;&quot;, species)) Another thing that jumps to sight is the stage column, which appears to be telling the same thing always. Lets check. unique(penguins$stage) ## [1] &quot;Adult, 1 Egg Stage&quot; Since its all the same, I can choose to remove it. penguins$stage &lt;- NULL 4.3.4 Dealing with NA values Now lets deal with NA values. First lets quickly identify which columns have NA values, and how many of them each one has. We could just look at the summary(penguins), or we could do this with other base R commands, like so: sapply(penguins, function(x) sum(is.na(x))) ## studyname sample_number species region ## 0 0 0 0 ## island ID clutch_completion date_egg ## 0 0 0 0 ## culmen_length_mm culmen_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## 2 2 2 2 ## sex delta_15_n_ooo delta_13_c_ooo comments ## 11 14 13 290 apply(is.na(penguins), 2, sum) ## studyname sample_number species region ## 0 0 0 0 ## island ID clutch_completion date_egg ## 0 0 0 0 ## culmen_length_mm culmen_depth_mm flipper_length_mm body_mass_g ## 2 2 2 2 ## sex delta_15_n_ooo delta_13_c_ooo comments ## 11 14 13 290 Note: Go to https://www.guru99.com/r-apply-sapply-tapply.html to better understand apply and other functions. Or we can do something more elegant and use some packages that show us, with graphics, where our NAs are. Here are a few examples that I took from a quick google search: # Alternative 1 library(naniar) ## Warning: package &#39;naniar&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 library(UpSetR) ## Warning: package &#39;UpSetR&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 penguins %&gt;% as_shadow_upset() %&gt;% upset() # Alternative n2 library(visdat) ## Warning: package &#39;visdat&#39; was built under R version 4.1.3 vis_miss(penguins) ## Warning: `gather_()` was deprecated in tidyr 1.2.0. ## Please use `gather()` instead. ## This warning is displayed once every 8 hours. ## Call `lifecycle::last_lifecycle_warnings()` to see where this warning was generated. Now, we need to decide what to do with these NA values. We can see below that two penguins have data missing from their base features (e.g., culmen_lenght and body_mass). Also, a few of them dont have information regarding sex. Since these are critical features, Im gonna go ahead and eliminate these entries. We can do so by several ways, but below you have two examples on how to eliminate NA values. # Example 1 penguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;% filter(!is.na(culmen_length_mm), # show only rows that are not NA in the culmen_length_mm column !is.na(sex)) # show only rows that are not NA in the sex column # Example 2 penguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;% drop_na(culmen_length_mm, sex) Now for some final touches, I will transform the body mass columns units from grams to kilograms. # Converting body_mass from grams to kg penguins &lt;- penguins %&gt;% mutate(body_mass = body_mass_g/1000) %&gt;% mutate(body_mass_g = NULL) # removing old column To finish this data cleaning, its important to point out that we could have just done everything in one go, as exemplified below. Although as you can see, when dealing with too many things, its usually best to separate adjustments per chunks. penguins &lt;- penguins_raw %&gt;% rename(&#39;ID&#39; = &#39;Individual ID&#39;) %&gt;% rename_with(tolower) %&gt;% # lower-case every column rename_with(toupper, starts_with(&#39;ID&#39;)) %&gt;% # up-case column starting with &quot;ID&quot; rename_with(~gsub(&quot; &quot;, &quot;_&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% # subs every space (&quot; &quot;) with no space (&quot;_&quot;) rename_with(~gsub(&quot;\\\\(&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% #removes every &quot;(&quot; rename_with(~gsub(&quot;\\\\)&quot;, &quot;&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% # removes every &quot;)&quot; rename_with(~gsub(&quot;/&quot; ,&quot;&quot;, .x)) %&gt;% # removes / mutate(date_egg = as.Date(date_egg)) %&gt;% # turns the column to data format mutate(species = gsub(&quot; *\\\\(.*?\\\\) *&quot;, &quot;&quot;, species)) %&gt;% # removes text between parenthesis in species mutate(stage = NULL) %&gt;% # removes stage column filter(!is.na(culmen_length_mm), !is.na(sex)) %&gt;% # removes NA rows from these 2 columns mutate(body_mass = body_mass_g/1000) %&gt;% # transforms body_mass_g column to kilograms mutate(body_mass_g = NULL) 4.4 Summarising Before we start drawing graphs left and right, its important to also explore the data with data summaries (in text format). As mentioned, from my perspective, EDA isnt an exact science, in a sense that there is no appropriate set of measures to explore. Knowing what to do comes from both a) knowing your data, b) what your objectives are and c) experience. Below Im going to try to cover some aspects of EDA (first in text than with plots) that I would do when analysing this data. Lets start So, how many observations per specie are there in the data? penguins %&gt;% count(species) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## species n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Adelie Penguin 146 ## 2 Chinstrap penguin 68 ## 3 Gentoo penguin 119 Alternatively, we can use the functions tabyl() and adorn_totals() from the janitor package and create a more elaborate summary with percentages and totals. penguins %&gt;% janitor::tabyl(species) %&gt;% janitor::adorn_totals() ## species n percent ## Adelie Penguin 146 0.4384384 ## Chinstrap penguin 68 0.2042042 ## Gentoo penguin 119 0.3573574 ## Total 333 1.0000000 Alright, now lets say we want to know how they are distributed across islands penguins %&gt;% group_by(island) %&gt;% count(species) ## # A tibble: 5 x 3 ## # Groups: island [3] ## island species n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Biscoe Adelie Penguin 44 ## 2 Biscoe Gentoo penguin 119 ## 3 Dream Adelie Penguin 55 ## 4 Dream Chinstrap penguin 68 ## 5 Torgersen Adelie Penguin 47 What seem to be the main problems presented in the observation column? penguins %&gt;% filter(!is.na(comments)) %&gt;% count(comments) ## # A tibble: 4 x 2 ## comments n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Nest never observed with full clutch. 34 ## 2 Nest never observed with full clutch. Not enough blood for isotopes. 1 ## 3 No delta15N data received from lab. 1 ## 4 Not enough blood for isotopes. 7 Since we spotted that some comments only appear very often we could quickly do some data cleaning again. Namely we might wanna combine certain levels of a factor or characters that are less represented (compared to other levels) together, instead of representing each. In this case we would combine less represented types of comments into a single label (e.g., OtherProblems). For that we could use fct_lump(). This function lumps (joins) together factors or characters with little representation. We just need to say which column we want to use this on, and we can define other parameters of interest. These are: n: (specifying which of the most common to preserve, default being 1). If I say n = 2 only the two most common comments will be preserved, with the rest being labeled as OtherProblems. p: Alternative to n in which we can specify to preserve only the levels/characters which have at least a proportion of x. Again, if we said p = 0.2, only the comments which are represented in 20% of the data would be kept. other_level: Here you set the name attributed to the lumped factors. In this case we say OtherProblems. penguins %&gt;% mutate(comments2 = fct_lump(f=comments, n = 1, other_level = &#39;OtherProblems&#39;)) %&gt;% View() Anyway, back to exploring the data Now lets ask the mean for each specie across all columns in the dataframe, where the values are numeric. We can do this, by simply grouping the data by species, that using the command below. penguins %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(across(where(is.numeric), mean, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% View() 4.5 Plots 4.5.1 Formula https://r-graph-gallery.com/ R has a natural plot language, but its quite primitive and complicated. It is adequate if you want really quick plots with minimal customization. Otherwise I would recommend using ggplot2. ggplot2 uses a distinct grammar for expression plots. It may seem complicated at first, but its actually quite simple. So every plot must start with a simple command: ggplot2(\"dataframe\", aes(\"data\")) In the first parameter you just tell the command which dataframe to use. Assuming your dataframe is labeled as df you can just the following: ggplot(df, aes(\"data\")) or df %&gt;% ggplot(aes(\"data\")) The next thing we need to do is specify which variables and measures we want to add to the plot. This is done inside the aes() command. You can add the obvious x and y info, and you can also add group related info, which can be coded as color, fill or shape. Heres a few generic examples: ggplot(df, aes(x = weight, y = height)) ggplot(df, aes(x = education_level, y = average_grade)) ggplot(df, aes(x = country, y = height, color = sex)) ggplot(df, aes(x = country, y = average_reading_time, color = sex, shape = genre)) After this is specified, you just need to add layers of what you want. By adding, I mean inserting a + and specifying the layers you want. Do you want points? Bars? Lines? Circles? Whatever you want, youll add each as a layer with geom_something(), with the something corresponding to what you want. ggplot2 has plenty of geoms, and Ill be showing you a few below. If you want to see what the rest can do, visit: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ So your general plot code for a simple bar plot should look something like: ggplot(dataframe, aes(x = variable, y = variable2)) + geom_bar() Lastly, you might want to specify other little details, such as the labels, the theme, the color scheme, etc. You can specify hundreds of things. Im just gonna leave you the commands I use the most and I think will be most useful to you. # Specifying the labels labs(x = &#39;x-axis label&#39;, y = &#39;y-axis label&#39;, title = &#39;title text&#39;, color = &#39;color label text&#39;) # Specifying the lower and upper bounds of the axis coord_cartesian(ylim = c(&#39;lower_y_limit&#39;, &#39;upper_y_limit&#39;), xlim = c(&#39;lower_x_limit&#39;, &#39;upper_y_limit&#39;)) # Splitting the graphs creating several based on a grouping variable facet_wrap(~&#39;grouping_variable&#39;) # Themes (just some examples) theme_classic() theme_light() theme_gray() If you want to save your plots you can do so either by clicking in the Export button on your Plots separator or you can use the function ggsave(). Well this should give you a general idea on how plots work. For more info, visit: http://r-statistics.co/Complete-Ggplot2-Tutorial-Part1-With-R-Code.html On to some examples with our data. Note: I purposely leave some additional parameters inside each plot building code, not to confuse you, but to introduce you more ways to tweak your plot. I encourage you to mess with them. 4.5.2 Cols and Bars The bar plot is one of the most common ones. R has two types of bar plots. geom_bar: Creates proportional count of entries (same as count but in a plot). Only requires one variable. geom_col: Creates a more typical bar plot, where the height represents values/statistics of the data, Heres an example usage of geom_bar # Count penguins %&gt;% count(species) ## # A tibble: 3 x 2 ## species n ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 Adelie Penguin 146 ## 2 Chinstrap penguin 68 ## 3 Gentoo penguin 119 # Geom bar (count as a plot) penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(species)) + geom_bar(fill = &#39;darkgreen&#39;, color = &#39;black&#39;, size = 2, width = .5) + theme_minimal() Now regarding geom_col and the more typical use of showing means. You have two ways of doing it, either: you compute the means and build the plot with geom_col() you use the stat_summary() function to compute the mean inside the ggplot and specify that you want the col geom (or bar geom). I usually just use stat_summary(), instead of pre-computing the means, because its faster and this allows me to add another function with stat_summary() that can also compute things like error bars. # 1. penguins %&gt;% group_by(species, sex) %&gt;% summarise(body_mass = mean(body_mass)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(species, body_mass, fill = sex)) + geom_col(position = position_dodge(.9), color = &#39;black&#39;) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 6)) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &#39;Plot with Means: Method 1&#39;) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;species&#39;. You can override using the ## `.groups` argument. # 2. penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(species, body_mass, fill = sex)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &#39;col&#39;, position = position_dodge(.9), color = &#39;black&#39;) + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 6)) + theme_minimal() + labs(title = &#39;Plot with Means: Method 2&#39;) 4.5.3 Boxplots Boxplots are a really cool way of showing you how your data is distributed across each category. Its particularly important when you have skewed data, or are just simply more interested in the median (as opposed to the mean). Below I introduce you the standard box plot, while also showing you other layers that can both appear on their own or can complement the boxplot geom, namely geom_jitter() and geom_violin(). penguins %&gt;% filter(!is.na(delta_15_n_ooo)) %&gt;% # remove NAs in the column to prevent warnings ggplot(aes(x = species, y = delta_15_n_ooo, fill = species)) + geom_boxplot() + geom_jitter(width = .1) + geom_violin(alpha = .25, size = 1) + # the alpha parameter models transparency (ranges from 0 to 1) theme_minimal() 4.5.4 Density Density plots are great and provide a simple way for you to measure distribution of a variables values. You just need to point out the variable name, in this case we will look at body_mass, and we will additionally want the distributions separated by species. penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass, fill = species)) + geom_density(alpha = .5) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &#39;Body mass (g)&#39;, y = &#39;Density&#39;, fill = &#39;Species&#39;, title = &#39;Body mass distributions across Species&#39;) + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) 4.5.5 Facets facet_wrap is quite useful if you want to compare two plots across 2 (or more) variables. It divides the data across the variable you name and creates two distinct plots. You just need to specify the variable, which in this case in done so with ~name_of_the_variable. Importantly, if you want the scales (y-limits and x-limits) to be adjusted for each variables info, you need to specify this using scales = 'free' if every scale (x and y) can vary between facets, or scales = 'free_x' and scales = 'free_y', if you just want the x or y scales to vary freely, respetively. In this case since we want to compare them directly, I think its best if they are fixed (the default behavior of the function), so you get a better picture as to how different they really are. penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = body_mass, fill = species)) + geom_density(alpha = .5) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &#39;Body mass (g)&#39;, y = &#39;Density&#39;, fill = &#39;Species&#39;, title = &#39;Body mass distributions across Species&#39;) + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) + facet_wrap(~sex, scales = &#39;fixed&#39;) 4.5.6 Coord flip For some plots, it might also be interesting (either more aesthetically pleasing or just a necessity given space limitations) to flip the coordinates. You can do so, by using the command coord_flip(). Heres an example. ggplot(penguins, aes(x = island, fill = species)) + geom_bar(alpha = 0.8) + scale_fill_manual(values = c(&quot;darkorange&quot;,&quot;purple&quot;,&quot;cyan4&quot;)) + theme_minimal() + facet_wrap(~species, ncol = 1) + coord_flip() 4.5.7 Correlation plots Another particularly useful feature that is usually (initially) explored with plots is correlations. So lets say we want to get a general idea about correlations between a set of variables in the dataframe. Heres a way to do it: correlations &lt;- penguins %&gt;% select(&#39;culmen_length_mm&#39;, &#39;culmen_depth_mm&#39;, &#39;flipper_length_mm&#39;, &#39;body_mass&#39;) %&gt;% cor() corrplot::corrplot(correlations, method = &#39;number&#39;) We can additionally separate this correlations by specie. For that we can use the function ggpairs() from the GGally package. penguins %&gt;% select(&#39;species&#39;,&#39;culmen_length_mm&#39;, &#39;culmen_depth_mm&#39;, &#39;flipper_length_mm&#39;, &#39;body_mass&#39;) %&gt;% GGally::ggpairs(aes(color = species), axisLabels = &#39;none&#39;) ## Registered S3 method overwritten by &#39;GGally&#39;: ## method from ## +.gg ggplot2 ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`. When you want to assess something more specific you can use a point plot. Point plots allow us to see how two numeric variables correlate with each other. In this example we explore how bill length and flipper length might be correlated, within each species. penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = culmen_length_mm, color = species, shape = species)) + geom_point(aes(group = species), size = 1.7) + geom_smooth(aes(group = species), method = &#39;lm&#39;, alpha = .2, formula = &#39;y ~ x&#39;) + # adding a line based on linear regression theme_minimal() + labs(x = &#39;Flipper Length (mm)&#39;, y = &#39;Bill Length (mm)&#39;, color = &#39;Species&#39;, shape = &#39;Species&#39;, title = &#39;Correlation between Flipper Length and Bill Length&#39;) + scale_color_brewer(palette = &quot;Dark2&quot;) 4.5.8 Multiplots Another cool thing we might want to do is add multiple plots to a final image. We can do this using the function multiplot from the packages Rmisc. Lets say we want to measure the mean of the deltas (both delta_15_n_ooo and delta_13_c_ooo), by species and sex. And we want to see them, side by side. To do so, we must create each plot separately, and assign it to a object. Afterwards, we just need to call these objects inside the multiplot function. Heres how to do it: d15_plot &lt;- penguins %&gt;% filter(!is.na(delta_15_n_ooo)) %&gt;% group_by(species, sex) %&gt;% summarise(delta_15 = mean(delta_15_n_ooo)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(species, delta_15, color = sex)) + geom_point(size = 5) + geom_line(aes(group = sex), size = 1) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;species&#39;. You can override using the ## `.groups` argument. d13_plot &lt;- penguins %&gt;% filter(!is.na(delta_13_c_ooo)) %&gt;% group_by(species, sex) %&gt;% summarise(delta_13 = mean(delta_13_c_ooo)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(species, delta_13, color = sex)) + geom_point(size = 5) + geom_line(aes(group = sex), size = 1) ## `summarise()` has grouped output by &#39;species&#39;. You can override using the ## `.groups` argument. Rmisc::multiplot(d15_plot, d13_plot) # or Rmisc::multiplot(d15_plot, d13_plot, cols = 2) # the cols parameter establishes the number of columns in the plot matrix 4.5.9 Date Plotting date is quite easy, and its quite useful when dealing with time-series analysis. In this data, as you will see, data is not that relevant. Below, I first build a general plot showing how many collections there were per date. Since I found a pattern, showing that these collection took place between November and December in three separate years, I then build three blocks of data for each year, and split the plot to better show the number of data entries per date. # Original plot penguins %&gt;% ggplot(aes(date_egg)) + geom_bar() # Transformed plot penguins %&gt;% mutate(DateBlock = case_when( # creating a new column that identifies which year that data bellongs to date_egg &lt; &#39;2008-01-01&#39; ~ &#39;2007&#39;, date_egg &gt; &#39;2008-01-01&#39; &amp; date_egg &lt; &#39;2009-01-01&#39; ~ &#39;2008&#39;, date_egg &gt; &#39;2009-01-01&#39; ~ &#39;2009&#39; )) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(date_egg)) + geom_bar(fill = &#39;lightblue&#39;, color = &#39;black&#39;) + facet_wrap(~DateBlock, scales = &#39;free_x&#39;) + theme_minimal() 4.5.10 Ordering factors Another useful function, is the function fct_reorder() which comes from the package forcats. This function is particularly (although not exclusively) useful for plots. As default, R organizes the levels in a factor by alphabetical order. This function allows us to alter the order by which levels in a factor are presented, according to certain conditions we can define ourselves. For instance if we plot the mean delta_15_ooo per species of penguin, we get the x-axis with (alphabettically defined) Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins. But lets say instead, we want to reorder the x-axis in a descending order according to mean delta_15 of each species. # Original plot penguins %&gt;% mutate(species = as.factor(species)) %&gt;% # Turning species to factor group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(delta_15 = mean(delta_15_n_ooo, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(species, delta_15)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &#39;bar&#39;, width=.75, fill = &#39;tomato1&#39;, color = &#39;black&#39;) + # plotting the mean theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10, vjust = 0.6)) +# just to show the x-axis text better coord_cartesian(ylim = c(5, 10)) # Reordered plot penguins %&gt;% group_by(species) %&gt;% summarise(delta_15 = mean(delta_15_n_ooo, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% mutate(species = fct_reorder(species, delta_15, .desc = TRUE)) %&gt;% # organized the levels of species based on delta_15 (descending) ggplot(aes(species, delta_15)) + stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = &#39;bar&#39;, width=.75, fill = &#39;tomato1&#39;, color = &#39;black&#39;) + # plotting the mean theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 10, vjust = 0.6)) + # just to show the x-axis text better coord_cartesian(ylim = c(5, 10)) 4.6 End "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
