# Introduction

This is a guide on R and its role in basic data manipulation.
It requires no prior experience/knowledge in R.

Currently, it is divided into 3 chapters.

-   **Chapter 1** will introduce you to R and provide you the basic programming tools, alongside other useful tips, to help you navigate R.

-   **Chapter 2** will introduce you to data management tools.

-   **Chapter 3** will introduce you to a more practical example of data exploration, emphasizing plot building.

In the future I plan to further elaborate on this guide, but for now I think its good enough for most people to get a picture on what R is, why you should use it, as well as, of course, how to use it.

I hope you learn something and find this guide useful.
